# Water Leak Detection and Classification with Complex-valued Neural Networks and Sensor Fusion


**Abstract**

Water scarcity is a critical issue: the impact of leaks and pipe breaks accounts for 30% of urban water
loss, contributing significantly to the global water crisis. Early detection offers a multitude of benefits,
including improved water distribution efficiency, minimized repair costs, and reduced environmental
impact associated with water loss. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel method for water
leak detection utilizing acoustic sensor signals. The novelty of our work lies in the use of a complex
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and in the fusion of signals acquired from multiple sensors like
hydrophones and accelerometers. The integration of diverse sensor information offers a promising avenue
for improving the reliability and efficiency of water leak detection systems. In addition, we also address the
problem of leak classification, which has not been much explored yet in the literature. The effectiveness
of the proposed method is validated through experimentation on two distinct datasets. With our proposed
method, we are able to achieve a balanced accuracy value of 99% for both detection and classification
problems. The results demonstrate that our solution outperforms recent methods for leak detection and
classification, highlighting its potential to contribute significantly to improved water resource management.
